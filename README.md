Million dollar idea
V2 of story coming soon

Base Concepts:
*Time has no direction. It's just a frictional value which is high when you're bored and low when you're having fun. But in a higher dimension, where time has direction there's a possibility of time travel without the final result being a paradox. I intend to find that dimension-Protagonist.
*dimensions are split into odd and even dimensions. Protagonist can see and interact with entities from other odd dimensions which are lower than his dimension. whereas he cannot see or interact with entities from higher dimensions and even dimensions.
*Basically we live in a universe where we can travel between universes of the butterfly effect. it's introduced as new means of tourism.
*the two sub branches are where dimension eater was detonated(sector 0) and was not(sector 1).
* universe doesn't allow two version of same entities to exist(like soul twins) and will try to eliminate the foreign entity. if P travels in time,another P will already exist,so he has to die.
*Sector 0 and sector 1 are the 2 main branches in the butterfly effect tree of our universe. Sector 0 holds earth(lower odd dimension(or alienage as called by people from sector 1)). It was formed after a "dimension eater bomb" was used in a war between two major factions of the higher even dimension.
Sector 1 holds void(as people in earth call it) is a restricted space where strange occurrences(like people dying suddenly etc) take place. it has planets but no earth.
story: The protagonist intends to find about the origin of the universe.
it's the future. Lots have changed. there's only one government on earth-the humans. alien life forms exist and are currently at war. our protagonist (Mr. P) is a scientist who's in other side of sector 0(at some 0.59990329797) and has to return to 0.0. but there's a war between two alien factions blocking his path, if in which he gets caught will be executed or they may steal his super secret package which he stole from an alien lab and is bringing back to earth.
so his only way is to go to sector 1 and get back to sector 0, it's much faster, except for the strange occurrings. but he risks it ,goes to sector 1 and returns back. but on his way back there's someone else in the ship. P holds "her" captive. she's an alien life form who denies the existence of earth. so he thinks perhaps she's from the alien labs who sneaked into his ship and who's lost her mind, so he leaves her to a doctor.
2 days later the doctor calls back claiming that she's perfectly normal. at the end of the third day and unknown alien faction declares war and is ready to attack earth. they ask for the prisoner whom the humans are holding as a "hostage" or they intend to destroy earth.
meanwhile P goes to the doctor and hears "her"(H) out. she claims she's originally from sector 1 and her people know about earth and many of them live here. they sneak into the ships when they pass by to come to earth. since they're in a higher even dimension in sector 1,no one can see them, but when they land in sector 0 they are compressed to a lower dimension and that's why P could see her.

H says that a war is going on between two huge factions spanning the universe and that she's a daughter of a general of faction 1. but the aliens who have come here are from faction 2. they intend to capture her and use her as hostage and a leverage to suppress  faction 1 even more. they've issued a time limit .
P finds it in his heart to help her and says he'll take her to her father in sector 1. but since he cannot see in sector 1(higher even dimension) H gives one of her eyes ( so that he can see in sector 1).since he has an eye of higher even dimension he can see unseen form of earth, a beautiful earth(new even dimension life forms,2d people etc).
as they land in sector 1,faction 1and faction 2 are already chasing  them  (not all of faction 2 knows their general's daughter(lol right?)).
so he manages to give faction 2 general his daughter after lots of adventures(and still the war between 2 factions continue). he finds  out the existence of time machine in this dimension, but  time travel is restricted as they tend to end up in paradoxes.
so he returns back to earth,but to his horror, the people from faction 1 got angry that he ran off with H and destroyed earth.now he wants to recreate earth(it's because he feels responsible for the billions of lives).
so he asks H's guidance. H says there's a way, to go back in time where dimension eater was used.it'll create a paradox which the universe will try to avoid using butterfly effect branching and them in one of the universes, earth will exist again.
P goes back in time to the part before the dimension eater was used. now a paradox is created. in the main branch of butterfly effect tree,he wasn't originally present when the bomb detonated,but now he is,so the universe tries to repair that and branches the main branch.
as a result there are 2 main branches and 4 sub branches.but due to the universe trying to repair the paradox it puts P in a time loop where he has to go through that all over again and the dimensions in sector 1 and 0 are exponentially added.(there are 2 sector 1's and two sector 0's, 
*sector 1-even dimension
*sector 1.5-even+1 dimension
*sector 0-odd dimension
*sector 0.5-odd+1 dimension(this is where P is reborn again since fabric of universe stays the same)
P dies there with the bomb(he had to detonate it so that sector 0 is created again).Now we come to present P.present P is stuck in a time loop and has to go through it again and again unless he does something different.he also vaugely remembers earth not getting destroyed and he gets a lot of headaches.
thanks to P's genius, he finds out that time is directional in sector 1.5,so now he goes to sector 1.5,goes back in time before the earth was destroyed and kills faction 1 leader(the universe tries to destroy him by throwing lots of stuff in his way as another P already exists)( a paradox is not created as time is directional,he's dynamically modifying the fabric of the universe).then he goes back to sector 1.5 and moves forward in time to after time after the destruction of original earth(earth is not destroyed now and i just wanted to let you know the time).
note-P understands that he will be stuck in a time loop he he goes back in time and also earth gets destroyed if he doesn't eliminate faction 1.
he's saved the day.now that he can time travel freely,he goes back to the origin of mankind,in the end, creating another paradox, Adam, Eve and mr.P
